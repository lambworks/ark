# Ark

This repository contains a simple sci-fi themed webpage. The design features a dark radial gradient background and uses the [Orbitron](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Orbitron) font for a minimal, futuristic feel. A centered input field lets you type text and, when you press **Enter**, the letters briefly scramble before resolving back to your text, mimicking a digital display effect.

Host the `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `scramble.js` files on any static site platform such as Cloudflare Pages to see the effect.
